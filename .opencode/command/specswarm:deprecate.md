## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Execute phased deprecation workflow to safely sunset features while providing migration guidance to users.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Phased Approach**: Announce → Migrate → Remove
2. **Migration Guidance**: Provide clear alternatives
3. **User Support**: Help users migrate
4. **Track Adoption**: Monitor migration progress
5. **Safe Removal**: Only remove when migration complete

**Phases**: Announce deprecation, user migration support, feature removal

**Coverage**: Addresses ~5% of development work (feature evolution)

---

## Smart Integration

```bash
SPECSWARM_INSTALLED=$(claude plugin list | grep -q "specswarm" && echo "true" || echo "false")
SPECTEST_INSTALLED=$(claude plugin list | grep -q "spectest" && echo "true" || echo "false")

if [ "$SPECTEST_INSTALLED" = "true" ]; then
  ENABLE_HOOKS=true
  ENABLE_METRICS=true
fi
```

---

## Execution Steps

### 1. Discover Deprecation Context

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)
DEPRECATE_NUM=$(echo "$CURRENT_BRANCH" | grep -oE 'deprecate/([0-9]{3})' | grep -oE '[0-9]{3}')

if [ -z "$DEPRECATE_NUM" ]; then
  echo "📉 Deprecate Workflow"
  echo "Provide deprecation number:"
  read -p "Deprecation number: " DEPRECATE_NUM
  DEPRECATE_NUM=$(printf "%03d" $DEPRECATE_NUM)
fi

# Source features location helper
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
PLUGIN_DIR="$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")"
source "$PLUGIN_DIR/lib/features-location.sh"

# Initialize features directory
ensure_features_dir "$REPO_ROOT"

FEATURE_DIR="${FEATURES_DIR}/${DEPRECATE_NUM}-deprecate"
mkdir -p "$FEATURE_DIR"

DEPRECATE_SPEC="${FEATURE_DIR}/deprecate.md"
MIGRATION_GUIDE="${FEATURE_DIR}/migration-guide.md"
TASKS_FILE="${FEATURE_DIR}/tasks.md"
```

---

### 2. Identify Feature to Deprecate

```
📉 Feature Deprecation

Which feature are you deprecating?
[User input or scan codebase]

Feature to deprecate: [name]
