## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Goal

Safely rollback a feature that failed or is no longer wanted, including:
1. Reverting all code changes since branch creation
2. Cleaning up feature artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
3. Optionally deleting the feature branch
4. Switching back to the parent branch

Provides two rollback strategies with comprehensive safety checks.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Safety Checks

```bash
echo "🔍 Performing safety checks..."
echo ""

# Check 1: Get current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)

if [ -z "$CURRENT_BRANCH" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: Not in a git repository"
  exit 1
fi

# Check 2: Prevent rollback of main/master/develop
PROTECTED_BRANCHES=("main" "master" "develop" "production")

for protected in "${PROTECTED_BRANCHES[@]}"; do
  if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "$protected" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Cannot rollback protected branch '$CURRENT_BRANCH'"
    echo ""
    echo "💡 Rollback is designed for feature branches only."
    echo "   If you need to revert changes on $CURRENT_BRANCH, use:"
    echo "   git revert <commit-hash>"
    exit 1
  fi
done

# Check 3: Check for uncommitted changes
DIRTY=$(git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null)

if [ -n "$DIRTY" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: Uncommitted changes detected"
  echo ""
  echo "You have uncommitted changes. Please commit or stash them first:"
  git status --short
  echo ""
  echo "To commit:"
  echo "  git add ."
  echo "  git commit -m \"WIP: save before rollback\""
  echo ""
  echo "To stash:"
  echo "  git stash push -m \"Before rollback\""
  exit 1
fi

# Check 4: Detect parent branch
# First try git config
PARENT_BRANCH=$(git config "branch.$CURRENT_BRANCH.parent" 2>/dev/null)

# Fallback to common parent branches
if [ -z "$PARENT_BRANCH" ]; then
  for candidate in "develop" "development" "dev" "main" "master"; do
    if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$candidate"; then

  echo "⚠️  Could not auto-detect parent branch"
  PARENT_BRANCH="main"  # default

echo "✅ Safety checks passed"
echo ""
```

### Step 2: Gather Rollback Information

```bash
echo "📊 Analyzing feature branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
echo ""

# Find divergence point from parent
DIVERGE_POINT=$(git merge-base "$CURRENT_BRANCH" "$PARENT_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null)

if [ -z "$DIVERGE_POINT" ]; then

  echo "   Please specify the correct parent branch."
  exit 1
fi

# Count commits to rollback
COMMIT_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count "$DIVERGE_POINT..$CURRENT_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null)
COMMITS=$(git log --oneline "$DIVERGE_POINT..$CURRENT_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null)

# Check if already merged to parent
MERGED=$(git branch --merged "$PARENT_BRANCH" | grep -w "$CURRENT_BRANCH" || true)

# Check for feature artifacts

    ARTIFACT_LIST+=("plan.md ($(wc -l < "$FEATURE_DIR/plan.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "0") lines)")
  fi
  if [ -f "$FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md" ]; then
    ARTIFACTS_FOUND=true
    TASK_COUNT=$(grep -c "^-" "$FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    TASK_COMPLETE=$(grep -c "^- \[x\]" "$FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

### Step 3: Dry Run Mode

**If `--dry-run` flag is present, show what would happen and exit:**

```bash
if echo "$ARGUMENTS" | grep -q "\-\-dry-run"; then
  echo "🔍 DRY RUN MODE - No changes will be made"
  echo ""
  echo "The following actions WOULD be performed:"
  echo ""
  echo "1. Rollback Strategy: (User would choose)"
  echo "   Option A: Soft rollback (create $COMMIT_COUNT revert commits)"
  echo "   Option B: Hard rollback (reset to $PARENT_BRANCH)"
  echo ""
  echo "2. Artifact Cleanup:"
  if [ "$ARTIFACTS_FOUND" = true ]; then
    echo "   - Delete or backup: ${ARTIFACT_LIST[*]}"
  else
    echo "   - No artifacts to clean up"
  fi
  echo ""
  echo "3. Branch Cleanup:"
  echo "   - Optionally delete branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
  echo ""
  echo "4. Final State:"
  echo "   - Switch to: $PARENT_BRANCH"
  echo ""
  echo "Run without --dry-run to execute rollback."
  exit 0
fi
```

---

### Step 4: Interactive Rollback Configuration (if not --force)

**Skip if `--force` flag is present (use soft rollback defaults).**

Use **AskUserQuestion** tool:

```
Question 1: "Choose rollback strategy"
Header: "Strategy"
Options:
  1. "Soft rollback (revert commits)"
     Description: "Creates revert commits, preserves history (RECOMMENDED)"
  2. "Hard rollback (reset to parent)"
     Description: "Deletes all commits, rewrites history (DANGEROUS)"
  3. "Cancel rollback"
     Description: "Abort and keep current state"
```

Store in `$ROLLBACK_STRATEGY`.

If `$ROLLBACK_STRATEGY` == "Cancel rollback", exit with message.

```
Question 2: "Delete feature branch after rollback?"
Header: "Branch Cleanup"
Options:
  1. "Yes, delete branch"
     Description: "Remove $CURRENT_BRANCH completely"
  2. "No, keep branch"
     Description: "Keep branch for reference (can delete later)"
```

Store in `$DELETE_BRANCH`.

```
Question 3 (if ARTIFACTS_FOUND=true): "What should we do with feature artifacts?"
Header: "Artifacts"
Options:
  1. "Delete artifacts"
     Description: "Remove spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md permanently"
  2. "Backup artifacts"
     Description: "Move to .feature.backup/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/"
  3. "Keep artifacts"
     Description: "Leave artifacts in place (not recommended)"
```

Store in `$ARTIFACT_ACTION`.

```
Question 4: "Final confirmation - Type 'rollback' to proceed"
Header: "Confirm"
Options:
  - Text input required
  - Must type exactly "rollback" (case-sensitive)
```

Store in `$CONFIRMATION`.

```bash
if [ "$CONFIRMATION" != "rollback" ]; then
  echo "❌ Rollback cancelled - confirmation text did not match"
  echo "   You must type exactly: rollback"
  exit 1
fi

## Important Notes

### Safety Features

1. **Protected Branch Prevention**: Cannot rollback main/master/develop/production
2. **Uncommitted Changes Check**: Requires clean working tree
3. **Confirmation Required**: Must type "rollback" to proceed (unless --force)
4. **Artifact Backup**: Option to backup before deletion
5. **Dry Run**: Preview changes before executing

### Rollback Strategies

**Soft Rollback (Recommended)**:
- Creates revert commits for each commit since divergence
- Preserves complete history
- Safe for shared/pushed branches
- Can be undone by reverting the reverts

**Hard Rollback (Dangerous)**:
- Resets to parent branch state
- Deletes all commits permanently
- Only safe for local-only branches
- Cannot be undone easily

### When to Use Each Strategy

**Use Soft Rollback when**:
- Branch has been pushed to remote
- Other developers may have based work on this branch
- You want to preserve history
- You're unsure if you might need the code later

**Use Hard Rollback when**:
- Branch is local-only (never pushed)
- You're absolutely certain code should be deleted
- You want a clean slate

### Remote Branch Handling

If branch is tracked remotely:
- Local branch can be deleted safely
- Remote branch deletion must be done manually:
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete feature-branch-name
  ```
- Provides command at end of rollback

### Merged Branch Rollback

If branch is already merged to parent:
- Soft rollback creates revert commits on current branch
- These reverts must then be merged to parent
- Hard rollback switches to parent (no changes to parent)
- Consider using `/specswarm:deprecate` for features in production

---

## Example Usage

### Basic Rollback (Interactive)
```bash
/specswarm:rollback
# Guided through strategy selection
# Confirms with "rollback" text
```

### Preview Rollback (Dry Run)
```bash
/specswarm:rollback --dry-run
# Shows what would happen without executing
```

### Quick Rollback with Defaults
```bash
/specswarm:rollback --force
# Uses soft rollback, no confirmation
# NOT RECOMMENDED unless you know what you're doing
```

### Rollback with Artifact Backup
```bash
/specswarm:rollback --keep-artifacts
# Backs up artifacts automatically
```

### Undo a Rollback (if soft rollback was used)
```bash
# Find the revert commits
git log --oneline | grep "Revert"

# Revert the reverts to restore original state
git revert <revert-commit-hash>
```
