description: Complete feature or bugfix workflow and merge to parent branch
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Complete feature or bugfix workflow by cleaning up, validating, committing, and merging to parent branch.

**Purpose**: Provide a clean, guided completion process for features and bugfixes developed with SpecSwarm workflows.

**Scope**: Handles cleanup → validation → commit → merge → branch deletion

**NEW**: Supports individual feature branches with auto-merge to parent branch (not just main)

---

## Pre-Flight Checks

```bash
# Ensure we're in a git repository
if ! git rev-parse --git-dir > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "❌ Error: Not in a git repository"
  echo ""
  echo "This command must be run from within a git repository."
  exit 1
fi

# Get repository root
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
```

## Execution Steps

## Error Handling

**If not in git repository:**
- Exit with clear error message

**If validation fails:**
- Show issues
- Offer to continue anyway or cancel

**If merge conflicts:**
- Provide clear resolution instructions
- Suggest --continue flag for resume

**If branch deletion fails:**
- Offer force delete option
- Allow keeping branch if user prefers

---

## Operating Principles

1. **User Guidance**: Clear, step-by-step process with explanations
2. **Safety First**: Confirm before destructive operations (merge, delete)
3. **Flexibility**: Allow skipping steps or customizing behavior
4. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files, update documentation
5. **Validation**: Check tests, build, TypeScript before merging
6. **Transparency**: Show what's being done at each step

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Diagnostic files cleaned up
✅ Pre-merge validation passed (or user acknowledged issues)
✅ Changes committed with proper message
✅ Merged to main branch
✅ Feature branch deleted (optional)
✅ Feature status updated to Complete

---

**Workflow Coverage**: Completes ~100% of feature/bugfix lifecycle
**User Experience**: Guided, safe, transparent completion process
